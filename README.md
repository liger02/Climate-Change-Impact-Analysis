# Climate-Change-Impact-Analysis

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the impact of climate change using historical climate data and predictive modeling techniques. The goal is to assess trends, visualize data patterns, and predict future climate conditions, contributing to a better understanding of how climate change affects our environment.

Features

Data Collection: Aggregates climate data from various reliable sources (e.g., NASA, NOAA, IPCC).

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset for analysis and modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes trends in temperature, COâ‚‚ levels, sea levels, and other climate indicators.

Impact Assessment: Evaluates the effects of climate change on regions, seasons, and specific environmental factors.

Predictive Modeling: Uses machine learning techniques (e.g., Linear Regression, Time Series Forecasting, LSTM) to predict future climate patterns.

Interactive Visualizations: Charts and maps for better understanding of climate trends and projections.
Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools:

Pandas, NumPy
